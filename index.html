        <p> 
            We want everyone to enjoy using Vault, and to open it up to the community for new features and requests. The plan is to open source Vault through Github, once it gets to a solid Beta Release. 
            This means that we plan to release Vault for free, but this may change depending on circumstances. It may be that with all the work invested in Vault, we may explore financial support in other ways.

        <h3 class="font-weight-light"> Vault Status (Updated July 2020) </small></h3>
        <p> Vault is now at Beta build 0.2.0. It is fully functional and working well! </p>
        <p> Vault is currently being tested in a closed-group for now, but will open more publically soon </p>
