            <h3 class="font-weight-heavy"> ITS GONE PUBLIC! </h3>
            <p> November 1st 2020</p>
            <P> Vault is now open for public testing.  <a href="https://github.com/Unreal-Vault/Vault-Dev"> Come check it out on Github. </a> </p>
            <p> 
                Vault has been in development for over a year now, so im super excited and nervous about how you will find it, it's been a big passion project for me, and taken a tonne of learning, but I feel strongly that it's a useful tool, and I hope you will find the same. 
                Please use the github issue tracker for any bugs, and come join the <a href="https://discord.gg/FrQT2GP"> Discord </a> if you want too.

        <h3 class="font-weight-light"> A shared asset library for you and your team </h3>
        <br>

        <p>
            I have been working in Film and TV for a long time, and it's so common to jump between projects on a frequent basis. The same goes for my passion of games development, I jump across Unreal projects super often. One thing I love about Unreal is the Launcher marketplace. 
            When I jump project, its there ready to populate my scenes with assets quickly. What I wanted though, was a way to share my assets, and those generated by the teams I worked with, in a similar way, to re-use and recycle to speed up production. This is the inspiration behind the Vault plugin. 
            The Vault allows you to: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Generate asset packs that contain all dependancies, with detailed metadata</li>
            <li>Back up those asset packs to your local machine, NAS, server or to a cloud synced folder</li>
            <li>Browse and Load your asset packs into any Unreal project, in a simple, organised UI</li>
            <li>Manage and share setting with a team, powered by JSON</li>
        </ul>
      

        <br>
        <h3 class="font-weight-light"> Open Source and FREE!* </h3>
        <p> 
            We want everyone to enjoy using Vault, and to open it up to the community for new features and requests. <strike>The plan is to open source Vault through Github, once it gets to a solid Beta Release. </strike>  ITS OUT NOW!
            Once we reach release 1.0, hopefully also open distribution of a pre-build plugin to the Unreal Marketplace
        </p>
        <p>
            * I plan to keep Vault free, but this may change depending on circumstances. It may be that with all the work invested in Vault, I may explore financial support in other ways. The goal is to always keep it free.
